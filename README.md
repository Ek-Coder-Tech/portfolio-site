# Web Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio website.

This site showcases a selection of real-world Python CLI projects I’ve built while learning and practicing through the SoloLearn Python Developer track and hands-on Upwork-style assignments. The goal: solve real problems with clean, beginner-friendly code.
